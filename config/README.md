# FlashMOB MongoDB ORM

This ORM is designed to work out of the box by a simple 

`const orm = require('./orm')`

out of the box. The orm object includes static methods that allow an API layer to interact with a MongoDB. In order to ensure everything is in order, try running the ormtest.js file first. The console should display a series of messages including "Test....SUCCESS" messages.

It uses promise based architecture so there should be no async concerns within the methods themselves. 

Methods can be used as follows:

## USERS CRUD

Creation

    orm.createUser(familyName, givenName, email, auth)
    .then((fulfilled) => {
        // Code to handle your returned data goes here. On success, you will receive an object from the ORM containing your new user
    })
    .catch((rejected) => {
        // If the user already exists, the request will be rejected and you will receive the USERS object that already exists. From here you can take its _id field, or whatever
    })

Querying for a user

    orm.getUserByID(userID)
    .then((fulfilled) => {
        // On success, you will be returned an array of the user who matches your query. This function should always only return one user
    }).catch((rejected) => {
        // This can return if there was an error, in which case you will receive the error, or it can return a string if you found no users.
    })

Change a users email

    orm.changeUserEmail(userID, newEmail)
    .then((fulfilled) => {
        // Upon fulfillment, returns the new user's object
    })
    .catch((rejected) => {
        // This call can be rejected if the email you're attempting to change to already exists, or there's an error
    })

Deleting a user

    orm.deleteUser(userID)
    .then((fulfilled) => {
        // I'm actually not sure what this returns. Papa bless
    })
